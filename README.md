# Bitcoin Miner with AI

This Python script integrates artificial intelligence (AI) into the process of Bitcoin mining. It utilizes various libraries and techniques to optimize the mining process and increase the chances of successfully solving blocks. Below is a brief overview of the functionalities provided by this script:

## Features

- **Asynchronous Mining**: The script implements asynchronous mining functionality to improve efficiency and resource utilization.
- **AI Model Integration**: It incorporates an AI model (Random Forest Regressor) to predict nonce values, enhancing the mining process.
- **Feature Extraction**: The script extracts relevant features from the block header to train the AI model, including nonce, timestamp, and version.
- **Training Model**: Provides a function to train the AI model using historical data and current training data.
- **Mining Loop Integration**: Integrates AI predictions into the mining loop to optimize nonce prediction and hash calculation.
- **Block Listener**: Implements a block listener to detect new blocks on the network and update mining operations accordingly.
- **Shutdown Handling**: Includes functionality to handle graceful shutdowns and clean up resources.

## Usage

To start mining, simply execute the script. It automatically initializes the mining process and continuously monitors for new blocks while adjusting mining parameters using AI predictions.

```bash
python SoloMining.py
```

## Requirements

- `requests`: For handling HTTP requests.
- `numpy`: Required for numerical computations.
- `scikit-learn`: Used for machine learning functionalities.
- `aiohttp`: Asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asynchronous mining operations.

## Configuration

Before running the script, make sure to configure the following parameters:

- `Bitcoin Address`: Set your Bitcoin address to receive mining rewards.
- `Mining Pool Details`: Provide details such as pool address, port, and authentication details.
- `AI Model Training Data`: Adjust training data and historical data for model training.
